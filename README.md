# Overview

Welcome!  Right now this project serves as a sandbox where I can try various Spring technologies.  I expect the code to be basic and the progress to be slow.  I'm more than a bit rusty on software engineering so I welcome any unsolicited feedback or code reviews.  With any luck this project will grow to encompass many different technologies offered by the Spring Team.

Expect the application to be over engineered and architected backwards to fit in specific technologies.  The goal is not elegant and simple but over engineered and unnecessarily complex.  Since the primary goal is learning technology I will frequently start with the answer and then find a use case.

## The Project

open-my-window seeks to provide the answer to a seemingly simple question.  "Should I open my window?"  (Making a simple question complex fits with the theme of this project as stated above.)  Depending on where you live and the time of year this may not be as straightforward as you think.  For example, during the summer in Pittsburgh PA it's usually a nice temperature in the morning (think 60's F) but sometime during the day it will likely get too hot to have a window open (think 80's F).  What time will that be?  When should the window be closed for the day?  Furthermore, is it just temperature we should consider?  What about air quality?  Humidity?  Precipitation?  Things get even more "interesting" in the Spring and Fall when temperatures can fluctuate even further!  Oh the excitement!

You could do what I usually do.  Look across the street at my retired neighbor who is always on top of things.  An immaculate yard, fresh flowers on the porch, a powerwashed driveway, and (most importantly) windows that just so happen to open and close at the perfect times each day for optimal comfort.  Or if you don't have such a neighbor you could use this unnecessarily complex app.  Well, you can't use it yet.  But perhaps someday.
